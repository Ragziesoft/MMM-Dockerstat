DISCLAIMER: THIS MODULE IS STILL RAW AND NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL
# MMM-Dockerstat
This module attempts to checks the status of docker containers running on another Raspberry Pi machine in the same network, and displays the status on the MagicMirror.
The entire code of this module has been written with help from ChatGPT. I had to constantly task ChatGPT to refine different aspects of the module and create a working code.
The module presently displays a rotating arrow icon to indicate module is checking the status of the docker container. There are bugs in the code. However, it is actually not able to probe and check the current status. ChatGPT is unable to make it work the way it is designed to (at the moment, maybe in the future it may) and is going into a loop with various suggestions that start getting complicated. Finally it advised me to get help from the community/forum. So it needs to be debugged. I am uploading the code in an attempt for the community to do the debugging and make it work. The idea for the module is for it to ssh into the second pi machine probe the status of the docker container and, list all containers with their current status in a table in an asthetic form.
